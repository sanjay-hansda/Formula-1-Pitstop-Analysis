# Objective

This notebook will explore F1 pit stop data and gain a better understanding of how the pit stop plays its role in the F1 Grand Prix. Using the findings, I will attempt to answer the questions below which will hopefully yield some new perspectives on the sport!

# Questions I want to answer:

How did pit stop durations change over time?  Is there a relationship between pit stop durations and constructor?

Is there a relationship between pit stop durations and race circuit?

What is the time spent in the pit lane as a percentage of the race?

Who is the best constructor on pit stop performance?
