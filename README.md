# Objective

This notebook will explore F1 pit stop data and gain a better understanding of how the pit stop plays its role in the F1 Grand Prix. Using the findings, I will attempt to answer the questions below which will hopefully yield some new perspectives on the sport!

# Data Analysis

The data is analyzed to find insights and answer various questions related to F1 races. The analysis includes correlation analysis, and visualization using Matplotlib library.

The questions explored here are :

1. How did pit stop durations change over time?  Is there a relationship between pit stop durations and constructor?

2. Is there a relationship between pit stop durations and race circuit?

3. What is the time spent in the pit lane as a percentage of the race?

4. Who is the best constructor on pit stop performance?
