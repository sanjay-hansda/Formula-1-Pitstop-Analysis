# Formula-1-Pitstop-Analysis
Objective
This notebook will explore F1 pit stop data and gain a better understanding of how the pit stop plays its role in the F1 Grand Prix. Using the findings, I will attempt to answer the questions below which will hopefully yield some new perspectives on the sport!

Questions I want to answer:
How did pit stop durations change over time?
Is there a relationship between pit stop durations and constructor?
Is there a relationship between pit stop durations and race circuit?
What is the time spent in the pit lane as a percentage of the race?
Who is the best constructor on pit stop performance?
